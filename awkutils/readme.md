AWK Utilities from <https://github.com/howerj/awkutils>. This is a collection
of AWK programs and rewrites of some Unix utilities in AWK (for when only AWK
exists on the platform). 

The rationale for collecting such utilities is that often I am stuck without a
full Unix environment, on Windows for example, but AWK is often very easy to
install, requiring adding just a single executable to the %PATH%. 

The programs are attributed in the file, if none is given, I have wrote it, 
and it is licensed under the WTFPL:
