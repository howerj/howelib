The programs in this distribution do file conversions between the
portable anymap formats and PRF.

Russell Marks' MRF (monochrome recursive format) is a simple and
effective file format for monochrome images. Impressed by its
elegance, I created PRF (polychrome recursive format) as a slightly
less simple and effective extension of his idea to non-monochrome
images.

The two programs, pnmtoprf and prftopnm, work like standard image file
converters.

The man page, prf(5), provides a concise description of the file
format. (And the source code can be considered to be a more detailed
description of the file format.)

The source code and other contents of this distribution are in the
public domain.
