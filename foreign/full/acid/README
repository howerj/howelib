A X-axis distorted smiley as a less than 256 bytes ELF executable for
Linux i386. I got immensely inspired by [1], which I came across when
surfing the web one day. I of course decided to do something similar,
and here it is.

The program 'acid' should run on at least all Linux i386 2.2 kernels.
Start the program like this.

$ ./acid

There's also a version for ARM v4 cpu's in the arm_v4 directory.
