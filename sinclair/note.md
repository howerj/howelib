## Notes, Odd algorithms for common mathematical operation.

These algorithms operate meant to operate with base 10 arithmetic, so to work
(more) efficiently in different bases they have to be changed, for example in
base 10 division by 1000 which occurs quite a lot is a shift left three places,
this would have to be replaced if operating in different bases.
