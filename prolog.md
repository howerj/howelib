# A small, embeddable, prolog interpreter written in C.

This prolog interpreter is meant to provide a very minimal prolog
environment and to be callable from other C programs. It is based on
[WProlog][], which is written in Java.

This project aims to be simple to use and small, the latter being the
most important, it should be considered a bug if the project goes above
5000 lines of code.
