# To-Do.
* Investigate all XXX.
* Use gprof and other profiling tools.
* Documentation for all magic numbers.
* Turn into library.
* Instead of calling exit(1) on failure longjmp and clean up.
* Hide internal structures from units that do not need to know
  about the internals of it (opaque structure).
