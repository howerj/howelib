Complete projects that come from else where. ie. Not-my-code!
If I have used other peoples code in my projects that should
be acknowledged in the files they are used in.

Most projects are stored as '\*.txz' files, I do this if they
are fairly big projects or if they are full git repositories 
themselves. Some projects do not actually contains the source
which is unfortunate. Other projects that are fairly small and
do not originate from a git repo are stored normally.
